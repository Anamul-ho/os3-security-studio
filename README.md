OS3 Security Studio is a comprehensive educational cyber security platform designed for hands-on learning. It combines interactive labs, vulnerability assessments, and security training into a single, approachable environment. The project targets students, educators, researchers, and professionals who want to sharpen their skills through practical exercises. The platform emphasizes repeatability, clarity, and a steady progression from fundamentals to advanced topics. It integrates real-world concepts with guided experiments, clear scoring, and actionable feedback.

This repository centers on delivering a robust learning ecosystem. It blends practical labs with theory, enabling learners to explore network security, web security, secure coding, incident response, and risk assessment in a controlled setting. The design favors clarity and reliability. It uses familiar tooling and a straightforward setup so instructors can adopt it quickly, and students can focus on the work rather than the infrastructure.

Key idea: education first. The platform guides learners from foundational concepts to complex scenarios. It keeps results visible and interpretable, so learners can track progress and reflect on what they did, why it mattered, and how to improve.

- Topics covered span cyber-lab basics to advanced security engineering.
- The learning path aligns with university curricula and professional training programs.
- The codebase emphasizes modularity so instructors can swap in new labs or modify existing ones with minimal friction.

If you want a secure, scalable, and transparent way to teach cyber security, this project offers a solid foundation with room to grow.

Why OS3 Security Studio
This project centers on practical, hands-on learning. Learners push the system to its limits in safe, controlled spaces. They observe how security controls behave, why certain configurations fail, and how attackers and defenders interact. The environment offers guided tasks, instant feedback, and measurable outcomes. It supports both individual study and classroom use.

Design goals
- Clarity: every lab includes goals, steps, expected outcomes, and scoring criteria.
- Reproducibility: labs run the same way across machines and environments.
- Modularity: each lab is independent, with clean interfaces for inputs, outputs, and scoring.
- Accessibility: material is approachable for beginners while still useful for advanced users.
- Safety: activities stay contained within lab bounds and do not affect external systems.

Core ideas and design principles
- Hands-on first: learners learn by doing, then reason about why things work.
- Incremental difficulty: labs build on previous work, with clear progression paths.
- Observable outcomes: learners see immediate feedback and score updates.
- Transparent scoring: assessments reflect specific actions and results.
- Traceability: labs produce logs, artifacts, and evidence of work for review.

How the platform works
- Front-end and back-end integration: a lightweight web interface communicates with a Flask-based API. The API orchestrates lab sessions, collects results, and manages state.
- Lab sandboxing: each lab runs in tight boundaries to keep experiments isolated. Containers or isolated processes host lab tasks.
- Lab authoring model: instructors create labs with clear steps, expected outcomes, and scoring rules. Labs are data-driven and easy to reuse.
- Assessment and feedback: the system analyzes learner actions, highlights mistakes, and points to best practices.
- Progress tracking: learners earn scores, badges, and certificates as they complete milestones.
- Extensibility: new labs, tools, and datasets can be added with minimal changes to core code.

Tech stack and architecture
- Back end: Python with Flask for the REST API and server-side rendering where needed.
- Front end: lightweight HTML/JS templates with minimal dependencies for reliability.
- Data: a relational store for users, labs, sessions, and results. The data model is designed for clear reporting and auditing.
- Lab runtime: containerized or isolated environments to host lab tasks and simulators.
- Security: input validation, least privilege execution, and activity logging ensure a safe learning space.
- Documentation: Markdown-based docs and inline examples help teachers and students understand how to operate the system.

Getting started
Prerequisites
